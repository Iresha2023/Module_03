PHP is a popular server-side scripting language used for web development. It stands for "Hypertext Preprocessor." PHP is used to create dynamic web pages and applications, meaning that the content of a page can change in response to user input or other factors. PHP is often used in combination with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create complete web applications.

PHP code is executed on the server before the resulting HTML is sent to the user's web browser. This allows developers to perform tasks such as accessing a database, processing form data, or generating dynamic content on the fly. PHP is free and open-source, and has a large community of developers who create libraries, frameworks, and tools to make development faster and easier. 

 Some dynamic web applications and websites that use PHP, includes:

Content management systems (CMS) - such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.
E-commerce platforms - such as Magento, Shopify, and WooCommerce.
Social networking sites - such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
Online forums and communities - such as phpBB and vBulletin.
Web-based applications - such as project management tools, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and online chat systems.
